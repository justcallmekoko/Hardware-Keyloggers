# Hardware-Keyloggers
Research done about modern hardware keyloggers

# Introduction
To be honest, I am starting from scratch here. Relative to what there is to know about hardware keyloggers, complex microcontrollers, and the USB protocol in general, I know nothing. I have written software based keyloggers in the past. Some have been very awful and stay top level and others have been decent and use keyboard hooks. Software based keyloggers have their advantages and disadvantages.  
**Software Keylogger Advantages**
- Physically undetectable (no physical presence)
- Victim keyboard functions as normal
- No physical access required for installation or exfil
**Software Keylogger Disadvantages**
- Detectable by antivirus
- Only logs keys after OS loads
- Uses computer resources  
I am really good at spelling and going down rabbit holes. I found out about hardware keyloggers when I went looking for alternate solutions. At first I saw [Spacehuhn's](https://github.com/spacehuhn) wifi keylogger project and I was impressed.
